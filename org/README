this is my collection of study from mind maps from the great book 
java concurrency in practise

The are in the popular format freemind, 

from Ubuntu apt-get install freemind

I think there are windows and mac versions available online

I've decided that to let the world share, please feel free to distribute

I've decided to distribute under the nice guy license,

Please mention my name when copying or referring or modifying the maps
and be nice to everyone for a whole day

other than that there are no restrictions


I've also recently added notes i made from  Victor Grazi's excellent talk java concurrency animated

I cant vouch for the completeness/accuracy , but i have made notes as faithfully as i can , please feel free to update improve re-factor

also if anyone fancies converting these into the excellent Emacs org mode, I love you already.

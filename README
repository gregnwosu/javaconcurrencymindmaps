this is my collection of study from mind maps from the great book 
java concurrency in practise

The are in the popular format freemind, 

from ubuntu apt-get install freemind

I think there are windows and mac versions available online

I've decided that to let the world share, please feel free to distribute

I've decided to distribute under the nice guy license,

Please mention my name when copying or refferring or modifying the maps
and be nice to everyone for a whole day

other than that there are no restrictions


I've also recently added notes i made from the excellent talk java concurrency anitmated

I cant vouch for the completeness/accuracy , but i have made notes as faithfully as i can , please feel free to update improve refactor

also if anyone fancies converting these into the excellent emacs org mode, I love you already.
